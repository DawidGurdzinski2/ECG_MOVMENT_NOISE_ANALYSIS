# ECG_MOVMENT_NOISE_ANALYSIS
Heart Rate Determination from Exercise ECG in the Presence of Motion Artifacts
The project involves analyzing a provided ECG signal recorded during walking and running on a treadmill. The signal contains significant artifacts, which vary across different time segments. The task is to apply at least two methods for detecting the QRS complex or the R peak (e.g., Pan-Tompkins and an autocorrelation-based method) in order to determine the heart rate trend.
The provided data, in ‘*.mat’ file format, also includes instantaneous heart rate values determined by ADInstruments software. The obtained heart rate trends should be quantitatively compared.
